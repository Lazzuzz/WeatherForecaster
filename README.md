# WeatherForecaser
This is a work-in-progress project where I am creating a weather forecast web page, using React single page app. The data used in the application is going to be supplied by WeatherApi (link: https://api.met.no/) via fetch, but the current implementation has not yet implemented this, and instead uses a static database of locations.
